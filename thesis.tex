% Lines starting with a percent sign (%) are comments. LaTeX will 
% not process those lines. Similarly, everything after a percent 
% sign in a line is considered a comment. To produce a percent sign
% in the output, write \% (backslash followed by the percent sign). 
% ==================================================================
% Usage instructions:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The file is heavily commented so that you know what the various
% commands do. Feel free to remove any comments you don't need from
% your own copy. When redistributing the example thesis file, please
% retain all the comments for the benefit of other thesis writers! 
% ==================================================================
% Compilation instructions: 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use pdflatex to compile! Input images are expected as PDF files.
% Example compilation:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You need to run pdflatex multiple times so that all the cross-references
% are fixed. pdflatex will tell you if you need to re-run it (a warning
% will be issued)  
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Compilation has been tested to work in ukk.cs.hut.fi and kosh.hut.fi
% - if you have problems of missing .sty -files, then the local LaTeX
% environment does not have all the required packages installed.
% For example, when compiling in vipunen.hut.fi, you get an error that
% tikz.sty is missing - in this case you must either compile somewhere
% else, or you cannot use TikZ graphics in your thesis and must therefore
% remove or comment out the tikz package and all the tikz definitions. 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% General information
% ==================================================================
% Package documentation:
% 
% The comments often refer to package documentation. (Almost) all LaTeX
% packages have documentation accompanying them, so you can read the
% package documentation for further information. When a package 'xxx' is
% installed to your local LaTeX environment (the document compiles
% when you have \usepackage{xxx} and LaTeX does not complain), you can 
% find the documentation somewhere in the local LaTeX texmf directory
% hierarchy. In ukk.cs.hut.fi, this is /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist,
% and the documentation for the titlesec package (for example) can be 
% found at /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/titlesec/titlesec.pdf.
% Most often the documentation is located as a PDF file in 
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xxx, where xxx is the package name; 
% however, documentation for TikZ is in
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf
% (this is because TikZ is a front-end for PGF, which is meant to be a 
% generic portable graphics format for LaTeX).
% You can try to look for the package manual using the ``find'' shell
% command in Linux machines; the find databases are up-to-date at least
% in ukk.cs.hut.fi. Just type ``find xxx'', where xxx is the package
% name, and you should find a documentation file.
% Note that in some packages, the documentation is in the DVI file
% format. In this case, you can copy the DVI file to your home directory,
% and convert it to PDF with the dvipdfm command (or you can read the
% DVI file directly with a DVI viewer).
% 
% If you can't find the documentation for a package, just try Googling
% for ``latex packagename''; most often you can get a direct link to the
% package manual in PDF format.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------


% Document class for the thesis is report
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can change this but do so at your own risk - it may break other things.
% Note that the option pdftext is used for pdflatex; there is no
% pdflatex option.

\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,oneside,pdftex]{report}

%\addtolength{\hoffset}{1cm} % use this setting for bigger print margins on left

% The input files (tex files) are encoded with the latin-1 encoding 
% (ISO-8859-1 works). Change the latin1-option if you use UTF8 
% (at some point LaTeX did not work with UTF8, but I'm not sure
% what the current situation is) 
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
% OT1 font encoding seems to work better than T1. Check the rendered
% PDF file to see if the fonts are encoded properly as vectors (instead
% of rendered bitmaps). You can do this by zooming very close to any letter 
% - if the letter is shown pixelated, you should change this setting 
% (try commenting out the entire line, for example).

% Font selection
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The default LaTeX font is a very good font for rendering your 
% thesis. It is a very professional font, which will always be 
% accepted. 
% If you, however, wish to spicen up your thesis, you can try out
% these font variants by uncommenting one of the following lines
% (or by finding another font package). The fonts shown here are 
% all fonts that you could use in your thesis (not too silly). 
% Changing the font causes the layouts to shift a bit; you many
% need to manually adjust some layouts. Check the warning messages
% LaTeX gives you.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% To find another font, check out the font catalogue from
% http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/mathfonts.html
% This link points to the list of fonts that support maths, but
% that's a fairly important point for master's theses.

% Optional packages
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Select those packages that you need for your thesis. You may delete
% or comment the rest.

% Natbib allows you to select the format of the bibliography references.
% The first example uses numbered citations: 
\usepackage[square,sort&compress,numbers]{natbib}

\newlength{\bibitemsep}\setlength{\bibitemsep}{18pt}
\newlength{\bibparskip}\setlength{\bibparskip}{0pt}
\let\oldthebibliography\thebibliography
\renewcommand\thebibliography[1]{%
  \oldthebibliography{#1}%
  \setlength{\parskip}{\bibitemsep}%
  \setlength{\itemsep}{\bibparskip}%
}

% The second example uses author-year citations.
% If you use author-year citations, change the bibliography style (below); 
% acm style does not work with author-year citations.
% Also, you should use \citet (cite in text) when you wish to refer
% to the author directly (\citet{blaablaa} said blaa blaa), and 
% \citep when you wish to refer similarly than with numbered citations
% (It has been said that blaa blaa~\citep{blaablaa}).
% \usepackage[square]{natbib}

% The alltt package provides an all-teletype environment that acts
% like verbatim but you can use LaTeX commands in it. Uncomment if 
% you want to use this environment. 
% \usepackage{alltt}

% The eurosym package provides a euro symbol. Use with \euro{}
%\usepackage{eurosym} 

% Verbatim provides a standard teletype environment that renders
% the text exactly as written in the tex file. Useful for code
% snippets (although you can also use the listings package to get
% automatic code formatting). 
\usepackage{verbatim}

% The listing package provides automatic code formatting utilities
% so that you can copy-paste code examples and have them rendered
% nicely. See the package documentation for details.
\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage{float}

% The fancuvrb package provides fancier verbatim environments 
% (you can, for example, put borders around the verbatim text area
% and so on). See package for details.
% \usepackage{fancyvrb}

% Supertabular provides a tabular environment that can span multiple 
% pages. 
%\usepackage{supertabular}
% Longtable provides a tabular environment that can span multiple 
% pages. This is used in the example acronyms file. 
\usepackage{longtable}

% The fancyhdr package allows you to set your the page headers 
% manually, and allows you to add separator lines and so on. 
% Check the package documentation. 
% \usepackage{fancyhdr}

% ofigure package allows you to use subfigures (i.e. many subfigures
% within one figure environment). These can have different labels and
% they are numbered automatically. Check the package documentation. 
\usepackage{subfigure}

% The titlesec package can be used to alter the look of the titles 
% of sections, chapters, and so on. This example uses the ``medium'' 
% package option which sets the titles to a medium size, making them
% a bit smaller than what is the default. You can fine-tune the 
% title fonts and sizes by using the package options. See the package
% documentation.
\usepackage[medium]{titlesec}

\usepackage{pgfplots, pgfplotstable}
\usepgfplotslibrary{groupplots}
\usepgfplotslibrary{dateplot}


% The TikZ package allows you to create professional technical figures.
% The learning curve is quite steep, but it is definitely worth it if 
% you wish to have really good-looking technical figures. 
\usepackage{tikz}
% You also need to specify which TikZ libraries you use
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}
\usetikzlibrary{calc}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.pathmorphing,decorations.markings}

% Load this package second-to-last, just before the hyperref package.
% Options that you can use:

%   doublenumbering - [optional] number the first pages of the thesis
%                     with roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...); and start
%                     arabic numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) only on the 
%                     first page of the first chapter
%   twoinstructors  - changes the title of instructors to plural form

% Layout settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% When you write in English, you should use the standard LaTeX 
% paragraph formatting: paragraphs are indented, and there is no 
% space between paragraphs.
% When writing in Finnish, we often use no indentation in the
% beginning of the paragraph, and there is some space between the 
% paragraphs. 

% If you write your thesis Finnish, uncomment these lines; if 
% you write in English, leave these lines commented! 
%\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
%\setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

% Use this to control how much space there is between each line of text.
% 1 is normal (no extra space), 1.3 is about one-half more space, and
% 1.6 is about double line spacing.  
% \linespread{1} % This is the default
%\linespread{1.15}
\usepackage{setspace}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\onehalfspacing

% Bibliography style
% acm style gives you a basic reference style. It works only with numbered
% references.
\bibliographystyle{acm}
% Plainnat is a plain style that works with both numbered and name citations.
% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}


% Extra hyphenation settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can list here all the files that are not hyphenated correctly.
% You can provide many \hyphenation commands and/or separate each word
% with a space inside a single command. Put hyphens in the places where
% a word can be hyphenated.
% Note that (by default) LaTeX will not hyphenate words that already
% have a hyphen in them (for example, if you write ``structure-modification 
% operation'', the word structure-modification will never be hyphenated).
% You need a special package to hyphenate those words.
\hyphenation{}


% Hyperref
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Hyperref creates links from URLs, for references, and creates a
% TOC in the PDF file.
% This package must be the last one you include, because it has
% compatibility issues with many other packages and it fixes
% those issues when it is loaded.   
\RequirePackage[pdftex]{hyperref}
% Setup hyperref so that links are clickable but do not look 
% different
\hypersetup{colorlinks=false,raiselinks=false,breaklinks=true}
\hypersetup{pdfborder={0 0 0}}
\hypersetup{bookmarksnumbered=true}
% The following line suggests the PDF reader that it should show the 
% first level of bookmarks opened in the hierarchical bookmark view. 
\hypersetup{bookmarksopen=true,bookmarksopenlevel=1}
% Hyperref can also set up the PDF metadata fields. These are
% set a bit later on, after the thesis setup.

\thesisabstract{english}{
When first introduced to programming, students are often assigned to write mere code snippets that only produce a numerical output with the help of a simple control structure. The students are left unimpressed as they fail to see the real utility that learning to program holds. By assigning students real-world programming problems, such as games and media computation exercises, we showcase real applications for programming.

At the beginning of their first programming course, students are already used to working with modern, interactive, and visually impressive interfaces. However, they cannot be expected to produce the graphical user interfaces required to take the full advantage of media content. Previously, we have distributed interfaces implemented with Swing as program code for local execution; the practise does not allow the easy updating of assignment related code and achieving a usable interface is tiresome with the use of Swing.

To address the issues of the current process, we developed a web-based system that allows the execution of interactive Scala programs in a browser. The system combines student's code together with the instructor prepared code and compiles it to JavaScript code. The design of the system is a novel one and takes the use of modern web technologies. The system was trialled with a media programming course in 2015 with encouraging results. Despite the technical difficulties, the system helped addressing the challenges encountered in implementing and distributing modern graphical user interfaces.

Jo ennen ensimmäistä ohjelmointikurssinsa alkua opiskelijat ovat tottuneita interaktiivisten ja visuaalisesti näyttävien käyttöliittymien käyttäjiä. Heidän ei kuitenkaan voida odottaa itse tuottavan käyttöliittymiä, jotka hyödyntävät mediasisältöjä. Aikaisemmin olemme tarjonneet käyttöliittymät Swing-kirjaston avulla toteutettuna ohjelmakoodina, joita opiskelijat ovat suorittaneet omalla tietokoneillaan. Tämä ei kuitenkaan mahdollista helppoa tapaa päivittää tehtävänantoon liittyvää koodia, minkä lisäksi onnistuneiden käyttöliittymien aikaansaaminen Swing-kirjaston avulla on työlästä.

Ratkaisuksi näihin ongelmiin diplomityössä kehitettiin web-pohjainen järjestelmä, joka mahdollistaa interaktiivisten Scala-ohjelmien suorituksen selaimessa. Järjestelmä yhdistää opiskelijan tuottaman koodin opettajan valmisteleman koodiin ja kääntää nämä yhdessä JavaScript-ohjelmaksi. Järjestelmän toimintatapa on uudenlainen ja sen toteutuksessa on käytetty moderneja web-teknologioita. Järjestelmän koekäytössä mediaohjelmoinnin kurssilla vuonna 2015 saatiin lupaavia tuloksia. Teknisistä vaikeuksista huolimatta järjestelmä auttoi kohtaamaan modernien käyttöliittymien toteutukseen ja jakeluun liittyviä haasteita.

First and foremost I want to thank my supervisor Lauri, without whom this thesis would have stayed forever as work in progress. Our meetings pushed me forward and forced me to write even when I thought that I was permanently stuck. Similarly, my instructors Otto and Juha helped me especially at the beginning of the process when I was lost the most. I am also very grateful for the technical support that guys of LeTech group gave me; thank you Teemu L., Lassi, and Teemu S.

Of my friends, I would especially like to thank Elina and Karoliina who shared this experience with me. Our lunches in the summer and autumn of 2015, when you were writing your theses, gave an outlet to vent our shared pain. Furthermore, thanks to all and any of my friends who have made the mistake of asking me what my thesis was about and then kindly listened when I explained it in lengths. 

Huge thanks are due to all my colleagues at Avarko, who have been understanding and supporting during the final stages of writing this thesis.

I wish to thank Riku, who while doing his own thesis still had strength to listen to the problems I had with mine. Finally, I thank the rest of my family, who despite the long production process did not forget to regularly ask  when my thesis would be finished.
